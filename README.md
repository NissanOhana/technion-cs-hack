# CS Hackathon - Doing Good :)

### Made for the CS Hackathon - Doing Good. Feel free to use and enjoy coding ðŸ¤“

- React app & Firebase
- Eeach commit - a development phase, so you can follow in your own phase.

## Phase 6 - Home Page Layout

Lets take our data that we fetched from the DB and "visualize" it with components!

- We add type for the data collection
- We need to create a new component - for that, I refactor the file structre and create "HomePage" directory.
- We took the data from the DB, and iterate it. Each item, we send as a prop to the new compoent the we made.
- We use the Card component from MUI from creating the FriendCard component.
